MarkLogic Sublime Plugin
-------------------------------
This plugin provides autocomplete, language highlighting, and linting for MarkLogic code.


Create your own Settings
-------------------------------
You will want to create your own settings file. This will allow you to keep your settings
even if you update the plugin.

1. Go to Preferences -> Package Settings -> MarkLogic -> Settings - Default
2. Copy the contents of the file
3. Go to Preferences -> Package Settings -> MarkLogic -> Settings - User
4. Paste the contents of the file


Linting
-------------------------------
We highly recommend you lint your XQuery files. You can enable the
"save on lint" feature by opening the command Palette and finding "MarkLogic: Toggle Lint on Save".

Alternatively you can access the plugin settings via the Menu at:
Preferences -> Package Settings -> MarkLogic -> Settings - User


Pointing to a MarkLogic Server
-------------------------------
If your project is using the Roxy Deployer then nothing needs to be configured. If you are not using Roxy then
you will need to tell the plugin where your MarkLogic Server is located.

Follow the instruction above for creating a copy of the settings.

Now you can change the values under the "xcc" heading to point to your MarkLogic server

// settings for Xcc connection
"xcc": {

	// Use Settings from Roxy's properties files
	// If this is not a Roxy project then the setttings above will be used
	"use_roxy_settings": true,

	// The roxy environment configuration to use
	// Valid choices are usually local, dev, prod but may vary
	"roxy_environment": "local",

	// MarkLogic hostname
	"ml_host": "localhost",

	// Xcc port to communicate with for running queries
	"xcc_port": "8041",

	// The content database to use when evaluating queries
	"content_database": "Documents",

	// The modules database to use when evaluating queries
	"modules_database": "Modules",

	// user name to use when authenticating to xcc
	"user": "admin",

	// password name to use when authenticating to xcc
	"password": "admin",

	// Whether or not to use https when communicating with Xcc
	"use_https": false
}
